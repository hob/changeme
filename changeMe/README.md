# Change Me
The goal of change me is to create small programs that need to be modified in some small way in order to convey a programming concept.

## Hello World
This program outputs `Hello World` as written.  Change the program replacing `World` with your name so that the output greets you!
### Running
```
go run .\changeMe\helloWorld\hello_world.go
```

## Hello Args
The result of running this program should be the same as in `Hello World`.  The only difference is in where you make the change to get the output you want.
### Running
```
go run .\changeMe\helloArgs\hello_args.go World
```
